Hey! I'm Nitay Alon (for English speakers - pronounce like knit-tie), a CS PhD student with [Jeffrey Rosenschein (HUJI)](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/) and [Peter Dayan (Max Planck Institute)](https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan). My main research field is Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). 
In particular, my research aims at understanding the role of cognitive hierarchies, known as Theory of Mind (ToM) in MARL. I focus on mixed-motive problems. You can see my publications [here](https://nitayalon.github.io/publications)
