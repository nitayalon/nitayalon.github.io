Welcome to my homepage! I'm Nitay Alon, a CS PhD student researching social aspects in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Here, you can find information about my [current research](https://nitayalon.github.io/active_research), [publications](https://nitayalon.github.io/publications), and more.

## About Me
I'm currently pursuing my PhD under the guidance of [Jeffrey Rosenschein (HUJI)](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/) and [Peter Dayan (Max Planck Institute)](https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan). My research focuses on understanding the role of cognitive hierarchies, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), in MARL, particularly in mixed-motive problems. You can learn more about me, my interests and my work [here](https://nitayalon.github.io/about).
