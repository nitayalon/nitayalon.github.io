### Limitations of ToM evaluation in LLM's
In [this work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13631) Eitan Wagner, Joe Barnby and Omri Abend argue that the way that ToM is evaluated in LLM's is imperfect. We need to take inspiration from Psychology and Economics to both refine the way we model ToM in LLM's as well as improve existing benchmarks and evaluation methods.
