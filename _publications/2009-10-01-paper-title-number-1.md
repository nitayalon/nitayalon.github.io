In this paper we explored the rise of deception stemming solely from Theory of Mind (ToM) and mixed motive game. We showed that agents use their ToM to deceive others in a simple buyer-seller game. In response to this manipulation, agents with higher ToM levels learned to ignore the behaviour of others, growing skeptic towards them - dismissing their actions as "cheap-talk". We used Information Theory to measure deception and skepticism.
