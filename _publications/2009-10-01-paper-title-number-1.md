In this paper (accepted as an oral talk) we explored the rise of deception stemming solely from Theory of Mind (ToM) and mixed motive game. We showed that agents use their ToM to deceive others in a simple buyer-seller game. In response to this manipulation, agents with higher ToM levels learned to ignore the behaviour of others, growing skeptic towards them - dismissing their actions as "cheap-talk". We used Information Theory to measure deception and skepticism.
