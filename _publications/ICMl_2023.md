In this work (**accepted as an oral talk**), we explored how deep recursive opponent modeling (high level of theory of mind) leads to paranoia like behaviour in mixed motive games.

We simulated agents with varying degree of Depth of Mentalisation (DoM) - the number of nested models they assign to others, in the iterated ultimatum game to show that when very high DoM agents interact with very simple agents (who play randomlly), the high level DoM agent classify these random agents as sophisticaed deceptive agents.
